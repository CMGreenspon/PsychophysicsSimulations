    "# Psychometric functions\n",
    "In psychophysics we tend to try and find the boundary between two barely distinguishable events. That might be the absence vs presence of a stimulus or the exact change in stimulus parameter required to observe a difference. Signal detection theory treats all events as distributions from which the intensity can be sampled at a given point in time. The practical consequence of this is that when the stimulus is delivered on two (or N) separate occasions two (or N) different events will be perceived - depending on the sample from the distribution. To contextualize this in standard psychophysical tasks, "
